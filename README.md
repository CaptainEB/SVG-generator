# SVG Generator

This NodeJs application asks for some information about the logo you want to create and the creates a 'logo.svg' file
in the examples directory. The app uses inquirer to get the user info and jest for unit tests.

The following screenshot was captured after we created an SVG file with the following options:
text: tax
text color: yellow
shape: square
shape color: blue
